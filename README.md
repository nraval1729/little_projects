This repo contains some of my smaller projects (mostly python scripts). All these projects have no specific purposes other than being fun to do.

1) vocabulary_quiz.py is a python script that scrapes (word, meaning) off of the randomlists website, and permutes each such tuple, and presents them to the user in the form of a quiz. The user can then assess their vocabulary superpowers by trying out the quiz.

2) everyday_script.py is a python script that queries a table (of birthdates, anniversaries, contact information) everyday and emails the specified people informing them about the current day's birthdays/anniversaries. Created solely to save my grandma's time and effort in searching her scattered, paper directories everyday in order to figure out if anyone had a birthday/anniversary in our family. Now she's my "tech" grandma, since she gets all this info delivered to her email...and can directly contact anyone who happens to have a birthay/anniversary on the current day. Yes, we created a gmail account for her. Obviously, for the sake of privacy, I have changed the actual email addresses, and authentication, and also have not uploaded the actual database. Cheers!
