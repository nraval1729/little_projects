This repo contains some of my smaller projects (mostly python scripts). All these projects have no specific purposes other than being fun to do.

1) vocabulary_quiz.py is a python script that scrapes (word, meaning) off of the randomlists website, and permutes each such tuple, and presents them to the user in the form of a quiz. The user can then assess their vocabulary superpowers by trying out the quiz.
